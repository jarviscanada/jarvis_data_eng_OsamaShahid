I worked as a junior Software Developer at Select Vantage shortly afterwards, creating python scripts and trading tool to be used in equity markets. I am currently finishing up my Master degree in Computer Science and have joined Jarvis alongside. Since then, I have been collaborating with my team members in an Agile/Scrum enviroment to create backend applications. With that, I have acquired and solidified my knowledge by working on multiple projects specifically with technologies such as Linux/Bash, RDMS/PostgresSQL, Dockers, Maven, etc. I am passionate about solving real-world problems and want to move forward in my career as a Software Developer."
