# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I graduated with a Bachelor's in Chemistry from McMaster University, but have always had a keen interest in technology. I worked as a junior Software Developer at Select Vantage shortly afterward, creating python scripts and trading tools to be used in equity markets. I am currently finishing up my Master's degree in Computer Science and have joined Jarvis alongside. Since then, I have been collaborating with my team members in an Agile/Scrum environment to create backend applications. With that, I have acquired and solidified my knowledge by working on multiple projects, specifically with technologies such as Linux/Bash, RDMS/PostgresSQL, Dockers, Maven, etc. I am passionate about solving real-world problems and want to move my career forward as a Software Developer.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Implemented a clustering monitoring program that automates the collects hardware and CPU usage information from the Linux servers using Bash scripts and Crontab. The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database that was initialized using Dockers. It was later than queried to perform analytics on overall usage and identify downtimes during high server usage. We utilized Git as a version control tool and GitFlow branching strategy.
